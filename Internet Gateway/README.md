- Internet Gateway (IGW) is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.

- Internet Gateway enables resources (like EC2 instances) in public subnets to connect to the internet. Similarly, resources on the internet can initiate a connection to resources in your subnet using the public.

- If a VPC does not have an Internet Gateway, then the resources in the VPC cannot be accessed from the Internet (unless the traffic flows via a Corporate Network and VPN/Direct Connect).
