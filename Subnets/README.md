# Subnets

- A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a network that are reserved so that they're not available to everyone within the network, essentially dividing part of the network for private use. In a VPC these are private IP addresses that are not accessible via the public Internet, unlike typical IP addresses, which are publicly visible.
